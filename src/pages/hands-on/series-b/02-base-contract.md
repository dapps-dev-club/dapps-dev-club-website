WIP!

## Recap

In the previous workshop, we set up a project using
npm, Truffle, and Ganache.
Thus far, we have only had one default smart contract,
generated by Truffle.

In this workshop, we will create our own smart contract,
which will be the "base contract" used during the remainder
of the workshops in this series.
